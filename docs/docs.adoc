= Cipherly: a secure way to exchange secrets
:toc:

== Motivation

Cipherly was built to enable people to securely share secrets.
The main goals are post quantum security and usability, while minimizing the chance for human error by eliminating the need to exchange sensitive information (shared keys) or store private keys.

== Usage

The following paragraphs describe the exchange of a secret from a users perspective without diving into cryptographic details.

Every user that wants to be able to receive secrets has to register for an account, choosing a username and password.
The password is the basis for protecting all secrets shared with them.


Other people - without the need to create their own account - can share a secret with registered users by entering the recipients username and the secret.
The sender receives a link which identifies the secret.
The link can then be shared with the recipient using already established communication channels.
Since the link does not contain the secret or data used to decrypt the secret, it can be shared using unsafe means of communication.

When the recipient visits the provided link, their password is used to decrypt the secret and the original text is revealed.

=== Recipient verfication

When a user creates an account, they get a _fingerprint_ associated with their account, represented as a string of numbers and digits (this is a simplification, see <<Encapsulation Key fingerprints>> for a detailed explanation).
They can share this information with other people to allow them to verify that they are sharing a secret with the correct person.

Upon registration, users receive a link that contains both their username and fingerprint.
When a user visits the link to share a secret, the fingerprint is automatically validated using the information included in the link.
If the fingerprints do not match, the account might be compromised and any secret shared form now on may be accessed by another person.

== Cryptographic design

In this section the cryptographic details of the implementation are explained.
After a short introduction to the involved cryptographic primitives and a short summary of the system, a step by step explanation of the <<Registration/Key generation>>, <<Secret encryption>> and <<Secret decryption>> is given.


=== Cryptographic Primitives

==== Kyber/ML-KEM

==== AES

==== argon2id KDF

To generate material for the Kyber key pair is derived from the password the password chosen by the user.
In accordance to https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Publikationen/TechnischeRichtlinien/TR02102/BSI-TR-02102.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10[BSI TR-02102-1], (part B.1.3.) `argon2id` is used as key derivation function.
Parameter choice followes the recommendations from https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9106/[RFC9106] with lower RAM usage:

- t=3 iterations
- p=4 lanes
- 64 MiB of RAM
- tag size (output length) of 512 bits instead of the recommended 256 bits, to meet the requirements of the Kyber key pair generation
- the salt is "cipherly" followed by the username with at least 8 characters in length, giving a minimum length of 16 characters

==== SHA

Sha3 is used to generate the 256bit fingerprint of the encapsulation key.

=== Overview

Cipherly uses a combination of symetric and asymetric cryptography.
The secrets themselves are AES encrypted by the cient creating a secret.
The symmetric key is protected using the Kyber/ML-KEM Key Encapsulation Algorithm.
The encapsulation and decapsulation keys are generated from the users password.
The encapsulation key is stored in the database and available to the public.

The decapsulation key does not leave the client and is never shared with another party.

When a secret is created, the symmetric key is generated by the client and protected using the recipients encapsulation key before it is send to the server.
Only the recipient is able to decapsulate the symmetric key using their private decapsulation key and decrypt the secret.

While AES alone would be anough to implement a platform where users can exchange secrets, using Kybers key encapsulation capabilities reduces the risk of user errors because there is no need to exchange a secret key.

=== Registration/Key generation

- Alice chooses her username and  password
- Using a Key derivation function, 512bits are generated from the password
- From these bits, a Kyber key pair is generated
- The encapsulation key is stored on the server and available for other users

=== Secret encryption


- Bob fetches Alices encapsulation key form the server
- Bob enters the secret
- The secrets is encrypted using AES with a randomly generated symmetric key
- The symmetric key is encapsulated (encrypted) using Alices encapsulation key
- The encrypted secret and the encapsulated symmetric key are sent to the server

=== Secret decryption

- Alice fetches the encrypted secret and the encapsulated symmetric key from the server
- Alice enters her password to generate her keypair
- Using the decapsulation key, the symmetric key is decapsulated
- Using the symmetric key, the secret is decrypted


=== Encapsulation Key Fingerprints

A possible attack allowing someone else than the recipient to decrypt the symmetric key and thus the secret, is replacing the encapsulation key with one the attacker owns the matching decapsulation key for.
Besides the usual precautions - preventing people from chaingin other peoples encapsulation key - users have the ability to verify the encapsulation key used to decrypt the secret.

The fingerprint is the _SHA_ hash(TODO: which one?) of the encapsulation key.
It is displayed when users create their key.

==== Third party assets

While the Rust dependencies are compiled into the WASM binary, Alpine.js and Pico css are loaded from a CDN.
They are pinned to specific versions and use SRI hashes:footnote[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity] for integrity.

The Heroicons are included in the index.html file and not loaded from a CDN.

=== Backend

TODO: list of endpoints
TODO: how to audit
TODO: how to test the fingerprint feature

The backend is a Rust application providing a REST API over HTTP using _axum_ footnote:[https://crates.io/crates/axum].
All data is stored using _SQlite_ footnote:[https://www.sqlite.org/] and the _sqlx_ crate footnote:[https://crates.io/crates/sqlx].

== Future work

- one time secrets
	- can be seen one time
	- requirement: authorization before fetching, to avoid DOS by guessing ID
- authorization before fetching (challenge)
- multiple recipients
- cache fingerprints in local storage
